1. app: This folder contains the project's source code.
2. components: This folder contains reusable React components.

4. globals.css: This folder contains the project's global CSS styles.
5. layout.js: A root layout is the top-most layout in the root app directory. It is used to define the <html> and <body> tags and other globally shared UI.
6. page.js: A page is UI that is unique to a route.
7. node_modules: This folder contains all the Node.js packages and dependencies required by your project. It is auto-generated when you run npm install and should not be modified manually.
8. public: This folder contains static assets, such as images and documents.
9. next.config.js: This file is used to configure Next.js.
10. package.json: This file contains project metadata, including the project name, version, and dependencies. It also provides scripts for running the project, such as development mode, production build, etc.
11. package-lock.json: This is an auto-generated file that keeps track of the exact versions of dependencies installed in your project. It helps ensure consistent installations across different machines.
12. .gitignore: This file lists files and folders that should not be tracked by version control (Git). It's used to avoid committing unnecessary files to your repository
